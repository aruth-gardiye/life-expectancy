### Predicting Life Expectancy

This Jupyter Notebook is focused on predicting life expectancy using a dataset that includes various health, economic, and demographic factors. The process involves:

The dataset contains information on life expectancy along with various features such as GDP, schooling, healthcare expenditure, and other socio-economic indicators. This data is used to understand the factors influencing life expectancy and to build predictive models.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, outliers, and transforming data as needed. Missing values are filled using methods like forward fill, and outliers are either removed or imputed. Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are normalized or scaled to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. This includes visualizing data distributions, correlations between features, and identifying any patterns or anomalies. Techniques like pair plots, heatmaps, and summary statistics are used to gain insights into the data.

**Feature Selection**: Relevant features that have a significant impact on life expectancy are selected. This may involve correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or domain knowledge to identify the most influential factors.

**Model Building**: The cleaned and preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. Various machine learning models are then trained on the training data. Common models used for this task include:
- **Linear Regression**: For understanding linear relationships between features and life expectancy.
- **Random Forest**: For capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
- **Tuning Hyperparameters**: Hyperparameters of the Random Forest model are tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters.

**Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is able to predict life expectancy. The results are visualized to compare the actual versus predicted values and to identify any areas where the model may be underperforming.

**Findings and Insights**: The final step involves summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis. This includes discussing the most important features influencing life expectancy, the performance of different models, and any potential improvements that can be made. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting life expectancy and how well they can be predicted using machine learning models.
